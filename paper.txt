Structural modelingMethods: Sequencing of exons and intron–exon junctions of GALT gene was completed in unsolved cases by analysis of a long range PCR product. Structural consequences of novel missense variations were predicted using a homology model of GALT protein and a semi-automated analysis which integrates simulation of variations, structural analyses and two web servers dedicated to identify mutation-induced change of protein stability.
Results: Forty four novel variations were identified, among them 27 nucleotide substitutions. In silico modeling of these missense variations showed that 12 variations are predicted to impair subunit interactions and/ or active site conformation and that 23 variations modify H-bond or salt-bridge networks. Twenty variations decrease the global stability of the protein. Five variations had apparently no structural effect.
Conclusion: Our results expand the mutation spectrum in GALT gene and the list of GALT variations analyzed at the structural level, providing new data to assess the pathophysiology of galactosemia.

1. Introduction
   Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.12; GALT) which catalyzes the production of glucose-1-phosphate and uridyldiphosphate (UDP)-galactose from galactose-1-phosphate and UDP-glucose is important in the conversion of galactose into energy in most organisms.   Classic galactosemia (MIM# 230400) refers to severe galactose1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) deficiency and manifests within the first week of life with poor feeding, jaundice, vomiting, liver dysfunction, increased bleeding tendency and septicemia, leading to death if untreated. Dietary restriction of galactose produces a rapid clinical improvement in the neonate. However, the neurological and intellectual

prognoses of galactosemic patients are often poor and ovarian failure is frequently observed [1].
   The human GALT gene, located on chromosome 9p13 and spanning 3.94 kb of gDNA comprises 11 exons [2,3]. Classical galactosemia is characterized by a high allelic heterogeneity. By January 2012, 264 different variations in the GALT gene had been recorded in the ARUP GALT database (GALTdb) at http://www.arup.utah.edu/database/ GALT/GALT_welcome.php [4].
   The three-dimensional structure of the human GALT has still not been experimentally solved. However the structures of wild-type GALT from Escherichia coli [5,6] as well as of the inactive His166Gly site?directed mutant [7], complexed with different ligands have been solved through X-ray crystallography, and revealed that this enzyme is a dimer with two active sites, each one formed by amino acid residues contributed by both subunits.
   The aim of our study was to characterize the spectrum of GALT variations in the French population. We describe a strategy for mutation screening able to identify large rearrangements and deep intronic variations. Seventy eight different nucleotide sequence changes including 44 variations that have not been reported previously were found in 242 patients. Most of the GALT novel variations resulted in single amino acid changes. We used a computational approach, based on a three dimensional model of human GALT (PDB: 1R3A) created by homology modeling [8] to gain insights on their consequences at the structural level and analyze the relationship between structure impact and presence of long-term complications.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Patients
   Three hundred eighteen patients, of which 155 females (49%) and 163 males (51%), born between 1954 and 2011, have been registered in the two laboratories performing the biochemical and molecular diagnoses of galactosemia in France since the 1970s. Patients were derived from 275 families.
   In all cases, galactosemia was suspected owing to the clinical signs or because of a previous affected sibling. The diagnosis was confirmed by absent GALT activity in erythrocytes [9,10]. All the patients adhered to a strict galactose-free diet in infancy and childhood. Blood samples for DNA analysis have been obtained in 210 families from 242 patients whose age varied from 6 months to 57 years, including 52 patients between 6 months and 5 years (21%), 94 patients aged 5–17 years (39%) and 96 adults aged 18–57 years (40%). Forty three out of the 242 genotyped patients were not from European ancestry: 39 originated from Africa, of which 13 from Maghreb, 3 from Turkey and one from Polynesia. Patients or their parents have given their informed consent for genotyping.
2.2. DNA and RNA extraction
DNA was isolated from whole blood using the DNeasy minikit
(Qiagen).
   Total RNA was prepared from blood samples sent to the laboratory in Paxgene tubes (BD) using the Paxgene Blood RNA kit (Qiagen).
2.3. Exon by exon sequencing
   Eight pairs of primers were designed to amplify eight fragments covering the promoter region and exons 1, 2, 3–4, 5, 6–7, 8–9, 10, 11 and their respective splice site junctions (primer sequences and PCR conditions in Supplemental Table S1). An aliquot of each PCR product was treated with High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche) prior to bi-directional fluorescence sequencing using the same primers as for PCR amplification.
2.4. Long range PCR (LR-PCR) amplification of GALT
   A 5.9 kb fragment covering the entire GALT gene from the promoter region (1.2 kb upstream the first ATG) to the 3?UTR (0.9 kb downstream the termination codon) was amplified using Long Range Polymerase Chain Reaction (LR-PCR) as described by [11] with some modifications (sequences of forward (?1193F) and reverse (+4760R) primers and PCR conditions in Supplemental Table S1). The PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis on 0.6% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. After purification with the High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche), LR-PCR products were used as a template for sequencing the proximal 5? UTR region, exons and large adjacent intronic regions (>150 bp). Primers designed for PCR amplification of GALT fragments and primers ?1193F and +4760R were used for sequencing LR-PCR products.
2.5. Screening of the common deletion by a triplex PCR assay
   A triplex assay modified from [11] was designed using the two primers flanking the GALT gene (?1193F) and (+4760R) and a third one located within the deletion (+4100F) to score for the presence of the full length allele (primer sequences and PCR conditions in Table S1). This triplex protocol gives rise to amplicons of different lengths allowing the detection of both the deleted and the normal alleles. PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.
2.6. RT-PCR analyses
   Single strand cDNA was synthesized using an oligo-dT primer and the Omniscript RT Kit (Qiagen). The entire coding region of GALT was amplified in two overlapping fragments of 647 and 717 bp (GALT cDNA fragment A: exons 1–6 and GALT cDNA fragment B: exons 6–11). Allele specific oligonucleotides (GALT cDNA BRNO and GALT cDNA BRMU) were designed to separate normal and misspliced mRNAs generated by p.Gly338Gly variation (primer sequences and PCR conditions in Table S1). These fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 8% polyacrylamide gel prior to purification with the High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche) and sequencing.
2.7. Sequencing
   PCR and RT-PCR products were labeled with the Big Dye terminator v1.1 sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) and purified with the DyeEx2.0 spin kit (Qiagen). The sequence products were run on an automated ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) and the results were analyzed with SeqScape 2.5 software (Applied Biosystems).
   Nucleotides are numbered from the first adenine of the ATG translation initiation codon at position 117 in the GALT cDNA Reference Sequence NM_000155.2.
2.8. In silico analysis of missplicing effects
   Five different splicing prediction modules were used: Splice Site Finder, Gene Splicer, Splice Site Prediction by Neural Network, MaxEntScan and Human Splicing Finder. They were interrogated simultaneously using the integrated software ALAMUT V.2.0 (Interactive Biosoftware; http://www.interactive-biosoftware.com). These tools predict the effects of variations on splicing signals and splicing regulatory sequences (exonic and intronic splicing enhancers and silencers) in the sequence environment of the mutation. Default thresholds were used for all the analyses.

Fig. 1. Number of cases of classic galactosemia diagnosed by year in France.   Another free on-line bioinformatic tool, EX-SKIP (http://ex-skip.img. cas.cz/) [12] was used to determine the ratio between exonic splicing enhancers and silencers (ESE/ESS ratio) in the wild-type and variant exons and predict if the variant exon has a higher chance to skip.
2.9. In silico analysis of missense variations
   The same strategy previously published [13] was adopted to simulate missense variations in GALT enzyme, alone or in complex with UDP-galactose (for those variations predicted to affect the active site), and to analyze and predict their possible impacts on protein structure, in particular effects on secondary structures, variation of residue's solvent accessibility, disruption of H-bond and salt bridge patterns, presence of the variation into the active site or at the intersubunit interface. In addition, each variant was submitted to two different web servers to predict the variation-induced change of protein stability with respect to the wild-type enzyme: PoPMuSiC v.2.1 [14] and CUPSAT [15]. We considered reliable only results for which both predictors reached a consensus, otherwise, the effect of variation on protein stability was classified as “not determined”. All information obtained has been added to the GALT protein database [16] accessible at the Web address: http://bioinformatica.isa.cnr.it/ GALT.
   The impact of variation p.Asn97del on GALT structure was simulated with a classic protocol of homology modeling, using as reference the model of human GALT. Ten different models were created with Modeller 9.10 [17] and the best one in terms of stereochemistry and energy was chosen using PROCHECK [18] and ProsaII [19], respectively. The selected variant was submitted to the same analyses of the other missense variants.
3. Results
3.1. Epidemiology of galactosemia in France
   The detection rate of galactosemia has progressively increased in France to achieve a stable average value of 8 cases by year, since the 1990s (Fig. 1); given a birth rate of about 845,000 newborns per year, this gives a calculated frequency of 1 in 105,000.
3.2. Clinical data
   The occurrence of long term complications of galactosemia after 3 years of age was searched in 69 genotyped patients bearing rare GALT variations. Delayed milestones (DM), abnormalities of motor function (AMF), speech impairment (SI), ovarian dysfunction (OD) and white matter anomalies (WMA) were identified from medical records. In addition, cognitive problems were recognized from learning disturbances (LD), lack of professional training (LPT) or intellectual disability (ID) whereas a normal cognitive status was assigned to a school degree appropriate for age (ASD) or a completed professional training (CPT) for an intermediate skilled profession (ISP) or a University diploma (UD). The clinical phenotype was considered severe when negative outcomes were found and mild in their absence. Patients' data are reported in Table 1.
3.3. DNA analysis
   Sequencing the 5? upstream region and exons with flanking intronic sequences of the GALT gene enabled us to identify DNA variations in 207/210 families (99%). Mutations were resolved in the 3 remaining cases by using a second tier method of DNA testing (see below).
   Most of the putative disease-causing variations identified at this step were missense variations (n=54), the other variants being nonsense variants (n=10), small deletions (n=3) and exonic or intronic variations which could affect splicing (n=9). Table 1 summarizes the novel and previously published variations [21,22,24,26–30,32–40] and the corresponding genotypes and phenotypes. The most common nucleotide substitutions were p.Gln188Arg, p.Ser135Leu, p.Lys285Asn and p.Leu195Pro with allele frequencies of 52.6%, 7.1%, 6.2% and 5.7%

* indicates a stop codon;Ex: exon; Int: intron; na: not available; Cat: cataracts; DM: delayed milestones; AMF: Anomalies of Motor Function; SI: speech impairment; OD: ovarian dysfunction; LD: Learning Difficulties; LPT: lack of professional training; LSK: low skilled profession; ID: intellectual disability; WMA: white matter anomalies; ASD: appropriate school degree for age; CPT: complete professional training; ISK: intermediate skilled profession; UD: university diploma. Gray boxes highlight the common GALT variations, with the number of variant alleles corresponding to both homozygous and compound heterozygous patients. The impact on protein structure is classified as “high” when the enzymatic function or the intersubunit assembly is predicted to be impaired, “local” when there is a significant perturbation that affects a part of the protein not involving binding site and/or intersubunit interactions, “low” when there is a perturbation, but it is predicted not to be able to affect significantly protein structure and function (see also details in Table 3 for variations whose impact on protein structure and function had not been previously described). Genotypes are reported using the one letter nomenclature to minimize the column width. Age, sex, clinical phenotype and negative outcomes are only presentedonce incompound heterozygotes. Clinicalphenotype wasconsidered as expectedandquoted with EXP whentherewas a good correlation between the outcome andthepredicted impact of thetwo causative variationson GALT structure (i.e. two high-impact predicted variationswith a severe phenotypeor two low-impactpredicted variationswith a mild phenotype).
Phenotype was considered as discordant and quoted with DIS when it was not in agreement with the predicted impact of both variations on GALT structure.

respectively. Other missense variants were found once or twice except for a few ones observed in 3 to 6 probands (p.Val128Ile, p.Met142Lys, p.Arg148Gln, p.Val168Met, p.Arg231His, p.Arg272His, p.Arg333Trp,
p.Val337Ile and c.329-2A>C). Forty four nucleotide sequence changes were novel, among them 27 missense variations.
   The already described polymorphisms p.Thr292Thr and p.His315His and the p.Asn314Asp benign variants were also found in our population. Differentiation between the two p.Asn314Asp variants was based on the presence of the 5?UTR ?119–116 delGTCA deletion for the Duarte 2 variant [41] or the p.Leu212Leu polymorphism in exon 8 for the Los Angeles Duarte 1 variant [42]. Both variants were found in cis with a few other nucleotide substitutions as previously described [42].
   LR-PCR amplification of the whole GALT gene in one fragment of 5.9 kb enables us to look for deep intronic variations or to detect large heterozygous deletions in unsolved cases:
– a deep intronic variation (c.687+66T>A) was found in a patient heterozygous for the p.Lys285Asn mutation thanks to the ability to analyse large intronic regions (more than 150 bp away from exon boundaries) with a long range PCR template.
– DNA of an Ashkenasi female patient, homozygous for p.Gln188Arg variation, was analyzed by LR-PCR because the p.Gln188Arg variation was not found in her father's DNA. Agarose gel electrophoresis of GALT LR-PCR products showed the presence of both a normal and a grossly deleted alleles in the proband and her father (Supplemental Fig. S1A). The deletion breakpoints were identified by sequencing and corresponded to the complex del/ins rearrangement, already described [11], including a 5458 bp deletion covering exons 1–11 and inclusion of both a 117 bp sequence from the exon 8 to intron 8 region and a 12 bp sequence of unknown origin (Fig. S1B). Confirmation of this heterozygous rearrangement was further obtained by the triplex PCR protocol (Fig. S1C).
– Standard PCR did not succeed to amplify all the exons of the GALT gene in another Ashkenasi patient and his parents. The GALT gene copy number was estimated in parents by duplex real time PCR in a LightCycler instrument (co-amplification of small amplicons from GALT intron 7 and a control gene). Each parent displayed only one GALT copy instead of the two GALT copies found in controls [43]. The homozygous common Ashkenasi deletion was further identified in the proband by the triplex PCR protocol.
   DNA for allele assignment was obtained from parents in 104/210 families (49.5%). Segregation of mutations was not as expected in three families in which the paternal allele seemed to be of wild-type. A gross heterozygous rearrangement was found in the proband and father of family 1, as described above; paternity tests argued for exclusion of paternity in family 2 and supported the hypothesis of a de-novo mutation in family 3.
   Novel variations were the only changes observed in patients and they were absent in 200 control chromosomes. Novel missense or silent exonic variations were either absent or found at a very low frequency (about 1/10,500) in the Exome Variant Server database (http://evs.gs. washington.edu) including more than 5200 individuals of European American and African American descent, whereas the previously described polymorphisms p.Thr292Thr, p.His315His, have been reported with frequencies of about 300 alleles in 10,500.
   Most of these variations affect residues that are conserved in eukaryotic systems, but only one variation (p.Trp249Gly) affects a strictly conserved residue in nearly all known GALT sequences.
3.4. Putative missplicing GALT variations
   Bioinformatic predictive tools were used to look for a possible missplicing effect of exonic silent or intronic variations located out of the canonical splicing signals AG or GT.
   Different putative impacts were predicted by at least two algorithms (Table 2): creation of a new donor splice site for p.Gly338Gly variation, activation of a cryptic exonic acceptor splice site for p.Asn288Asn variation, reduction of the score of the natural acceptor splice site for c.83-3 C>G and c.83-11T>G variations, activation of a cryptic intronic donor splice site for c.687+66T>A variation.
   Modifications of ESE patterns possibly strengthening these variations were also found. They were not considered as predictive of splicing alteration alone, unless they appeared close to the exon junction and close to a weak natural splice site with a lower score than splice sites of adjacent exons (as observed for c.507+10G>A variation).
   Most of these potential splicing aberrations could not been experimentally confirmed by cDNA studies. A fresh blood sample for RNA extraction could be obtained only from the patient bearing the silent exonic variation p.Gly338Gly. Amplification of GALT cDNA bearing p.Gly338Gly variation revealed the presence of two species in fragment B (exons 6–11). In order to confirm the hypothesis of an alternative splice donor site within exon 10, allele specific amplification of the fragment B was performed, using two reverse primers respectively encompassing the normal and the alternative exon 10–exon 11 junctions (Supplemental Fig. S2). The two cDNA species were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sequencing demonstrated activation of the alternative donor site, resulting in the exclusion of 46 nucleotides at the end of exon 10, leading to a frameshift with the appearance of a premature stop codon at nt 1027 (p.Tyr339Leufs*5).
   A missplicing effect was ruled out for p.Arg67His, p.Phe131Ser, p.Val168Met, p.Ala191Asp, p.Leu218Pro and p.Arg272His missense variations, whose consequences upon GALT protein structure were not clear (Table 3). Changes in the strength of natural splice sites, appearance of alternative splice sites, and significant modifications of regulatory elements were not found using either ALAMUT or EX-SKIP Servers; conversely a splicing effect cannot be ruled out for p.Ser143Trp variation.
3.5. In silico analysis of GALT variations
   Perturbations on structure and function of GALT enzyme caused by 32 nucleotide substitutions (27 novel and the five previously described p.His114Pro, p.Gly175Asp, p.Arg328Cys, p.Glu340Lys, p.Arg359Trp variations that were not yet analyzed for their impact on protein's structure) and by the in frame deletion p.Asn97del were analyzed using computational biology methods. A summary of results of predictions made is shown in Table 3, and Fig. 2A shows the position of the residues involved in these missense variations in GALT structure.
   Four missense variations (p.Val128Ile, p.His186Tyr, p.Glu340Lys and p.Gln346Lys) show a predicted impact only on active site (Fig. 2B). Variation p.Val128Ile introduces a bigger residue in the active site, thus increasing the steric hindrance. Therefore, it can impair the correct ligand binding, since Val128 is located near the uridyl moiety of the substrate. Variation p.His186Tyr involves the residue of GALT enzyme responsible for the nucleotidic attack to the substrate [47] and is probably the variation with the potentially highest negative impact on protein function.
p.Glu340Lys is a variation in which a negatively charged residues forming H-bonds (as an acceptor) with the substrate is replaced by a positively charged residue, thus deeply perturbing the correct substrate binding. Similarly, p.Gln346Lys variation, located near (b5 Å) the sugar moiety of the substrate, can perturb deeply the interactions and the pattern of H-bonds in the active site of the enzyme.
   Five missense variations (p.Arg48Cys, p.Asn97Asp, p.Gly179Ser, p.Val337Ile and p.Tyr339Cys) and the in frame deletion p.Asn97del have a predicted impact on both active site and intersubunit interactions, since all of them are located at the intersubunit interface (Figs. 2A,B). Variation p.Arg48Cys involves a residue located near the phosphate-ribose moiety of the substrate that interacts with residue Gln346 of the same subunit (see above). In addition, it is noteworthy that the well known variation p.Gln188Arg is supposed to perturb the intersubunit interface because of steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion between Arg48 of one subunit and Arg188 of the other subunit [8]. Residue Asn97 is involved as a donor in a H-bond with the C_O of the uridyl moiety, therefore is an important residue for ligand binding. Its deletion, or its replacement with Asp, an acidic residue that is not able to form the same interaction, can have a negative impact on ligand binding. In particular, in variant p.Asn97del not only the H-bond between residue 97 and the substrate is missed, but also the H-bonds between the substrate and Asp98 (adjacent Asn97), and new H-bonds are formed between the substrate and residues Ser181 and Asn182. Therefore, there is a deep alteration of the substrate binding. Variation p.Gly179Ser increases the number of H-bonds between substrate and

Five different splicing prediction modules were used to predict modifications of splice sites and ESE/ISE patterns: Splice Site Finder, Gene Splicer, Splice Site Prediction by Neural Network, MaxEntScan and Human Splicing Finder. They were interrogated simultaneously using the integrated software ALAMUT V.2.0 (Interactive Biosoftware; http:// www.interactive-biosoftware.com).

Programs used to predict the structural effects are: in-house procedures for analysis of interaction with substrate, intersubunit interaction and salt bridge perturbation [13]; DSSP for secondary structure perturbation [44], NACCESS for solvent accessibility [45], HBPLUS for H-bonds [46], the combination of servers PoPMuSiC 2.1 [14] and CUPSAT [15] for protein stability.

UDP-Gal is shown in CPK mode, residues that undergo the variations are represented in thin stick mode, and residues at the intersubunit interface are in ball and stick mode. The two subunits forming the dimer are colored in yellow and blue for monomers A and B, respectively. Color codes for atom types are: carbon green, oxygen red, nitrogen blue, and phosphorus magenta. The picture was created using Pymol (http://www.pymol.org/). B—Close-up of the active site of GALT enzyme, showing original residues (up) and variant residues (down) in proximity of the ligand. Wild type residues of the subunits A and B are colored in dark yellow and blue, respectively; variant residues of the subunits A and B are colored in yellow and cyan, respectively. UDP-Gal is shown in thick ball and stick mode, residues making also intersubunit contacts are in thin ball and stick mode, and the others are in stick mode. Color codes for atom types are: carbon green, oxygen red, nitrogen blue, phosphorus magenta. The picture was created using Insight II package (Ver-
   
sion 2000.1, Accelrys, Inc.; 2000).
   Other seven variations (p.His31Asn, p. His114Pro, p.Tyr221His, p.Arg231Cys, p.Trp249Gly, p.Arg328Cys, p.Arg333Leu) are at the intersubunit interface and then can perturb the correct dimeric association of GALT enzyme (Fig. 2A).
   Most of variations perturb the network of H-bond and/or saltbridge patterns in which the native residue is involved. Their impact depends on several factors such as the position in the protein and the interaction with other residues. In three cases (p.Ser135Pro, p.Ala191Asp, p.Arg272His) the structural effect is minimal and with no consequences on the final interaction. It is worthy to note that Ser135 corresponds to His115 in E. coli, a residue involved in Zn binding site [5] but this residue is not conserved among several GALT enzymes (including in humans), thus the role of Ser135 as a Zn-binding residue in human GALT is questionable.
   Only few variations are associated to predicted perturbations of the secondary structures such as p.Asp136His, or to a modification in solvent accessibility (Table 3). The variation p.Leu218Pro inserts a proline into an ?-helix, with potentially disruptive effects. However, our model did not predict secondary structure disruption.
   Finally, in twenty cases, the variations are predicted to perturb the overall stability of the protein (in the other cases, no consensus was reached between the two predictors).
   For two variations (p.Arg67His, p.Phe131Ser) our analyses were not able to predict any effect on protein structure and function, and for other three variations (p.Ser143Trp, p.Val168Met, p.Leu218Pro) only a reduced stability was predicted. In three of these cases (p.Arg67His, pSer143Trp, pVal168Met), variations affect residues that were previously analyzed for the impact of other protein changes on the structure and function of GALT enzyme [13,23], but also in these cases, no effects were predicted from simple static modeling.
3.6. Relationship between structure impact and long-term complications
   A simplified clinical phenotype based on the presence or absence of negative outcomes [48] was established from medical records of 66 patients older than 3 years of age, who were not homozygous for common mutations (Table 1); 45 out of 66 carried missense variations and most were compound heterozygous, particularly for the common severe variations p.Gln188Arg, p.Leu195Pro or p.Lys285Asn (80%). We decided to analyze the structure–outcome correlation in compound heterozygous patients, only if the two causative variations had a similar low or high impact on GALT protein structure. Twelve combinations between a high-impact and a low-impact predicted variations were not considered. Agreement of structure–outcome was found in 21 patients, all with high-impact predicted variations correlated to a severe phenotype. Twelve phenotypes were totally in disagreement with predicted structural impact: 11 patients carrying two high-impact predicted variations with a mild phenotype and one patient carrying two low-impact predicted variations with a severe phenotype. It was also noted that different phenotypes were observed in patients with the same genotype p.Arg333Trp/p.Gln188Arg. A higher score of structure– outcome agreement was found in patients carrying severe truncating mutations (11/13 patients).
4. Discussion
   It has been decided in France to maintain clinical vigilance rather than to implement neonatal screening for galactosemia because of the rarity of this disorder and because clinical symptoms of galactosemia are often apparent before screening results can be reported. The estimated frequency of galactosemia in France seems to be lower than in other European countries who implemented newborn screening (1:105,000 in France vs. 1:23,500 in Ireland [49] to 1:45,000 in West Germany [50]). However, the number of cases by year is very stable since the 1990s, arguing for a low number of missed cases.
   Our mutation screening strategy identified 100% of alleles in the patients from which a DNA sample could be obtained (90% of patients since 1996). This detection rate is higher than in previous studies [25,31]. In the majority of patients, variations have been recognized by sequencing GALT exons with a standard PCR protocol. Long range PCR amplification has been implemented as a second tier method of DNA testing to identify deep intronic variations and large heterozygous DNA rearrangements. Only one deep intronic mutation (c.1059+56C>T) had been reported previously, a long time ago [51].
   p.Gln188Arg is the most frequently occurring variation in Caucasian populations; the mutation reaches its higher frequency in Ireland and shows a gradient of declining frequency through Europe in a southeasterly direction [20]. Allele frequency of 52.6% in France is close to the 49% [52] and 46% [53] seen in the Iberian peninsula and Eastern Europe, respectively; p.Lys285Asn, the second most common European variation in the countries of central and Eastern Europe accounts only for 6.2% of alleles in France; p.Leu195Pro found in 5.7% of alleles in France, reaches a lower frequency than that observed in Hispanic populations [31]; p.Ser135Leu mutation was found exclusively in patients of African descent, as previously demonstrated in the Afro-American population [54]. The p.Phe171Ser mutation was also exclusive to black patients with galactosemia. The common Ashkenasi deletion is rare in France. Only two homozygous siblings and one heterozygous patient (5/420 alleles) were identified in the last 15 years when mutation screening was done in 90% of galactosemic patients.
   Assessment of the pathogenicity of exonic or intronic variations which could affect splicing was essentially done using bioinformatic tools since, in most cases, patient RNA was not available. Their accuracy was increased by the use of complementary distinct tools running distinct algorithms. It must be noted that the missplicing effects causing p.Gly338Gly variation were experimentally confirmed: this variant is currently classified as neutral in the ARUP data base; it is not listed as a polymorphism in the Exome Variant Server database.
   In silico methods were used to predict the impact of 33 variations (32 missense and 1 in-frame deletion) on structure and function of GALT enzyme. Of the 27 novel missense variations identified in this work, nine directly involve residues at the active site, and eleven residues are involved in inter-subunit interactions (with five variations showing both effects). These variations are then predicted to have a high impact on protein structure and function, even if in vitro confirmation by expression studies is still required.
   When variations affect H-bond or salt bridge networks in which the native residue is inserted, their impact depends on several factors such as the position in the protein or the interaction with other residues. The high percentage of variations predicted to have a negative impact on the overall stability of GALT enzyme is in line with our previous observations [13] (to date, only 1 variation included in GALT Prot database was predicted not to affect protein stability, and only 4 variations are predicted to increase the stability of the protein). Moreover, in a recent characterization of other novel GALT variations [23], mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified, and most of them showed solubility problems and/or reduced expression, thus supporting the idea that stability is a main issue in GALT variants.
   Our computational approach was not able to predict any specific structural or functional effects for five variations. A putative impact on splicing has been questioned using splicing predictive tools. A potential missplicing effect was found for p.Ser143Trp whereas no significant changes were identified for the other variations. These variations may also be associated to in vivo phenomena, or may cause e.g. the disruption of protein–protein complexes made by GALT into the cell.
   However, the hypothesis of unraveled structural effects should not be completely ruled out. In fact, even those variations with no apparent effects on the static model could have caused perturbations in the protein's structure and dynamics. One of the variations with no predicted structural effects (p.Val168Met) is very similar to another one (p.Val168Leu) that showed no effects in the static model, but showed alterations when submitted to a molecular dynamics simulation protocol [23]. Probably, a similar effect could be argued also for the variations characterized in this work.
   This work expands the spectrum of GALT variations explored at the structural level and compares the relationship between genotypes and negative outcomes using a large number of novel missense variations. However, a subset of our patients was still in childhood and the question of whether galactosemia is a progressive disease is still debated [55].
Interpretation of the results was also hampered by the compound heterozygosity of many patients for common severe GALT variations, but even in patients with two variations predicted to have a similar impact on GALT structure, the correlation with outcomes was not straightforward. Only 64% of patients had a clinical phenotype in agreement with the predicted impact on GALT structure, indicating that this analysis is not yet sufficiently informative in predicting the outcome. The mild presentation of the adult patient with the variation p.His186Tyr, impacting the catalytic residue, is particularly striking. More sophisticated tools, such as molecular dynamic simulation protocols should allow refining structural data, particularly in compound heterozygotes. The possibility that the Leloir pathway enzymes may form a multienzyme complex with protein–protein interactions and coordinated regulation of the genes encoding the protein has also to be explored [56] as well as how does the clinical phenotype evolve over time [55].
