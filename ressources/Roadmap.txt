Proposed Workflow for data processing

Quick Aim : tagging E-mail corpus using UMLS 'CUI'

Roadmap:

#1: approach 'strict matching' :
    KMP implementation : from a query, being able to seek inside doc.txt.
       	   		    extend to corpus
			    for each CUI in corpus, list of docs


#2: optimization :
    BM implementation : idem KMP (should work better than KMP as it's a long alphabet)
    Language detection (risk of decreased precision... to be discussed)
    	     IDEAS : same lang only comparison otherwise next doc
    Suffix tree (quite hard to implement....)
    

#3: shooting wider
    strategies to improve recall
    	       IDEAS: using re module => REGEX / similarity index
	       
	       

#4: other ways of thinking => experimental
    IDEAS : pattern matching / docs approach instead of thesaurus / ...


Evaluation:		
	software (more informations needed)
	human expertise (our own)  => tool to be developped to ease manual curation
	      	Assessement : 30 docs (20 FR / 10 EN) - 2 reviewers by doc - comparison in each notation
		IDEAS: lexicogrpahic ordering of TH strings / 2x10 window display around the query
		=> important: remove reference docs from corpus

Polishing (not a priority as not evaluated):
	 XML output by rebuilding each E-mail
	 Web based visualization.
